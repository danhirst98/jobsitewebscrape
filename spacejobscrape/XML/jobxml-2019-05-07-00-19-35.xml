                SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is
                fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the
                technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.
                SPACE OPERATIONS ENGINEER
                Are you passionate about human spaceflight? Do you enjoy complex technical systems and thrive in
                situations others might find stressful? Can you mentally decompose complicated operations methodically
                into constituent steps? If you are a collaborative engineer excited to contribute to the future of human
                spaceflight, the Space Operations Engineering role could be the challenge you've been looking for.
                The SpaceX Space Operations Team is revolutionizing spaceflight operations for our current and future
                missions: cargo and crew Dragon, private astronaut flights, and interplanetary exploration. The team is
                responsible for all facets of the safe and efficient delivery of astronauts and cargo in space. To
                support that goal, the Operations Development team conducts the mission planning, sustaining
                engineering, operational product development and introduction of new operations on each mission. As a
                space operations engineer, you will be responsible for developing the detailed concept of operations and
                resulting products the ground controllers and flight crew will need to execute the mission.
                As a member of the team, you will learn how to fly the Dragon spacecraft from SpaceX's Mission Control
                Center. In turn, you will use your skills and firsthand experience to develop future operations plans
                and products the flight controllers will use for current and future missions.
                Helping to lead spacecraft operations requires mental dexterity, rigorous technical understanding of the
                spacecraft&#8217;s systems, and a deep understanding of contingency scenarios. Your contributions will
                help SpaceX successfully execute cargo and human spaceflight missions, and to achieve our goal of making

                SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is
                fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the
                technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of&#160;enabling human life on Mars.
                BUILD ENGINEER (STARSHIP)

                technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of&#160;enabling human life on Mars.
                PROPULSION COMPONENTS ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                The Propulsion Components team develops the most advanced spacecraft and launch vehicle components in
                the world. Our engineers serve as hardware experts for the flow control devices that drive the critical
                capabilities on our Dragon and Falcon vehicles - from engine throttling to attitude control. We design
                and build valves, regulators, and actuators for maximum reliability in extreme environments, with
                temperatures ranging from +900F to -400F and pressures beyond 10,000 psig. Propulsion component
                engineers are expected to lead their own projects from concept to flight using their strength in design
                and hands-on assembly and testing. A trip to Mars requires lightweight, manufacturable components that
                can withstand the acceleration of a launch vehicle while demonstrating the precision and reliability of
                a spacecraft. Through 3 hands-on rotations, this program equips engineers to lead the design of

                talented SMT process engineer to establish a pilot line and eventually ramp to full scale production for
                the consumer-facing user terminal (a high volume manufactured product customers will have in their
                homes).
                The success of Starlink depends on the quality, reliability, cost, manufacturability, throughput, and
                security of the products that you deliver. If you seek a fast-paced, dynamic environment, if you thrive
                on solving difficult problems where resolutions have high impact, if you love managing through
                persuasion and if you love the challenge of building something from scratch, then this role will be an
                ideal next career step.
