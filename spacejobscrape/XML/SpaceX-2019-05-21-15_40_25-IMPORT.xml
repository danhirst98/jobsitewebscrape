PROPULSION COMPONENTS ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The Propulsion Components team develops the most advanced spacecraft and launch vehicle components in the world. Our engineers serve as hardware experts for the flow control devices that drive the critical capabilities on our Dragon and Falcon vehicles - from engine throttling to attitude control. We design and build valves, regulators, and actuators for maximum reliability in extreme environments, with temperatures ranging from +900F to -400F and pressures beyond 10,000 psig. Propulsion component engineers are expected to lead their own projects from concept to flight using their strength in design and hands-on assembly and testing. A trip to Mars requires lightweight, manufacturable components that can withstand the acceleration of a launch vehicle while demonstrating the precision and reliability of a spacecraft. Through 3 hands-on rotations, this program equips engineers to lead the design of innovative propulsion components to accelerate manned space exploration.
