                SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is
                fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the

                MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER (STARLINK USER TERMINAL)
                One of the most ambitious missions that SpaceX has undertaken to date, the Starlink satellite
                constellation is our solution to providing reliable internet to the entire world. We are looking for a
                talented, creative, and driven manufacturing engineer to build the consumer-facing user terminal (a high
                volume manufactured product customers will have in their homes). You will own the relationship between
                the engineering development and production teams. You will drive manufacturing tools and processes, from
                initial concept development to full scale production, and will interact regularly with senior leadership
                during critical design phases. The success of Starlink depends on the quality, reliability, cost,
                manufacturability, throughput, security, and user experience of the products that you deliver. If you
                seek a fast-paced, dynamic environment; if you thrive on solving difficult problems where resolutions
                have high impact; if you love managing through persuasion and if you love the challenge of building
                something from scratch, then this role will be an ideal next career step.

                SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is
                fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the
                technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.
                SPACE OPERATIONS ENGINEER
                Are you passionate about human spaceflight? Do you enjoy complex technical systems and thrive in
                situations others might find stressful? Can you mentally decompose complicated operations methodically
                into constituent steps? If you are a collaborative engineer excited to contribute to the future of human
                spaceflight, the Space Operations Engineering role could be the challenge you've been looking for.
                The SpaceX Space Operations Team is revolutionizing spaceflight operations for our current and future
                missions: cargo and crew Dragon, private astronaut flights, and interplanetary exploration. The team is
                responsible for all facets of the safe and efficient delivery of astronauts and cargo in space. To
                support that goal, the Operations Development team conducts the mission planning, sustaining
                engineering, operational product development and introduction of new operations on each mission. As a

                SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is
                fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the
                technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of&#160;enabling human life on Mars.
                BUILD ENGINEER (STARSHIP)
